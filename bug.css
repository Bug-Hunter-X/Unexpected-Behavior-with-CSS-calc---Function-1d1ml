The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations in CSS. However, it's crucial to understand that `calc()` doesn't handle units consistently across all browsers if used incorrectly. For instance, mixing units within the same calculation can lead to unexpected results.  A common mistake is something like: `width: calc(100% - 50px);` This works well. But `width: calc(100% - 50);` (missing 'px') might be parsed differently across browsers or might not work at all.  Another issue arises when dealing with nested `calc()` functions. The browser might have difficulty evaluating complex nested expressions.  Finally,  spaces around operators within the `calc()` expression are necessary.  Missing spaces, like `width:calc(100%-50px);`, can cause parsing errors.
